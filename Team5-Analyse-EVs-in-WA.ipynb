project aims to deepdive into the EV market in the state of Washington to:\n","* Identify adoption trends of electric vehicles (EVs) across cities in Washington, patterns and insights that would enable key stakeholders such as EV manufacturers and the government to understand the market dynamics of the EV market and key infrastructure requirements that would enable passing laws that ban gas powered cars.\n","* Analyze consumer behavior regarding EV adoption, looking into factors such as vehicle range, charging times, and maintenance costs in correlation with base MSRP.\n","* Examine the relationship between the adoption rates of EVs and the availability of charging infrastructure across various cities.\n","* Analyze the correlation between the MSRP of EVs and their popularity among different income groups.\n","\n","**Data Source:**\n","* Electric Vehicle Population Data: State of Washington ([Direct access
